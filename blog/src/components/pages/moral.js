				                        <p><i class="fa fa-id-card-o "></i>  Moral Values: Values have to do with what is <i><strong>good</strong></i> and <i><strong>bad </strong></i>   i.e something's worth. For example, becoming a nurse is a <i>good thing.</i></p>
				                        <p><i class="fa fa-legal"></i>  Moral Duties: Duties have to do with that which obligatory and binding upon us. <br> The Moral Values are not obligatory just as becoming a nurse is good, but not binding upon us.</p>
				                        <p><i class="fa fa-compass"></i>  Objective: That which is independent of people's opinion. Example: Hitler killing the Jews is objectively wrong irrespective of his beliefs.<p>
				                        <p><i class="fa fa-users"></i>  Subjective: That which is dependent upon people's opinions. Example: Bob thinks Vanilla ice-cream tastes better than Chocolate. <p>

				                        <h3>Let's think this through:</h3>
				                        <p>If there is no God, then we do not have any objective reference point so as to differentiate between good and evil. God's nature provides this objective reference point for moral values, since it serves as the standard of measure of morality (just as a scale measures length). To put it more crudely, if our existence is merely a chance collocation of atoms on a bed of dust and we are just bags of protoplasm floating in space, then all we are left with is one person's viewpoint which is subjective and non-binding upon all rather than objective. Each individual could have their own personal preferences of what is moral to them and they all could be different (just as our subjective choice of ice-cream flavours).</p>

Rather, this argument shows how inept atheism is of quaifying terms such as 'good' and 'bad' since if there is no objective reference point, it is merely subjective.
